# Test data files for Parquet compatibility and regression testing

| File                                         | Description                                                                                                                                                     |
|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| delta_byte_array.parquet                     | string columns with DELTA_BYTE_ARRAY encoding. See [delta_byte_array.md](delta_byte_array.md) for details.                                                      |
| delta_binary_packed.parquet                  | INT32 and INT64 columns with DELTA_BINARY_PACKED encoding. See [delta_binary_packed.md](delta_binary_packed.md) for details.                                    |
| delta_encoding_required_column.parquet       | required INT32 and STRING columns with delta encoding. See [delta_encoding_required_column.md](delta_encoding_required_column.md) for details.                  |
| delta_encoding_optional_column.parquet       | optional INT64 and STRING columns with delta encoding. See [delta_encoding_optional_column.md](delta_encoding_optional_column.md) for details.                  |
| nested_structs.rust.parquet                  | Used to test that the Rust Arrow reader can lookup the correct field from a nested struct. See [ARROW-11452](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-11452) |
| data_index_bloom_encoding_stats.parquet | optional STRING column. Contains optional metadata: bloom filters, column index, offset index and encoding stats.                                               |

## Encrypted Files

Tests files with .parquet.encrypted suffix are encrypted using Parquet Modular Encryption.

A detailed description of the Parquet Modular Encryption specification can be found here:
```
 https://github.com/apache/parquet-format/blob/encryption/Encryption.md
```

Following are the keys and key ids (when using key\_retriever) used to encrypt the encrypted columns and footer in the all the encrypted files:
* Encrypted/Signed Footer:
  * key:   {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0,1,2,3,4,5}
  * key_id: "kf"
* Encrypted column named double_field:
  * key:  {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0,1,2,3,4,5,0}
  * key_id: "kc1"
* Encrypted column named float_field:
  * key: {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0,1,2,3,4,5,1}
  * key_id: "kc2"

The following files are encrypted with AAD prefix "tester":
1. encrypt\_columns\_and\_footer\_disable\_aad\_storage.parquet.encrypted
2. encrypt\_columns\_and\_footer\_aad.parquet.encrypted


A sample that reads and checks these files can be found at the following tests:
```
cpp/src/parquet/encryption-read-configurations-test.cc
cpp/src/parquet/test-encryption-util.h
```
